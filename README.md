# Tic Tac Toe Game

This is a basic implementation of a tic tac toe game. This is relative to the project from The Odin Project.
The basis of the project was to use modules and factory function while maintaining a separation of concerns, I believe that I have made it close to the rules given.

It looks quite ugly as well, but for now I have achieved the functional point of the tic tac toe.
